Installation Guide
=====================

The kalmus package requires a python with version 3.7 or 3.8.

The package is released on PyPI (`Project Homepage <https://pypi.org/project/kalmus/>`_). After you install the
python==3.7, 3.8, you can install the kalmus using pip (recommended)::

    $ pip install kalmus

Alternatively, you could install the kalmus locally by first cloning the GitHub repo of Kalmus (`GitHub page <https://github.com/KALMUS-Color-Toolkit/KALMUS>`_).
Then, move to the top directory of cloned kalmus project folder and install using the pip command::

    $ pip install .

In both methods, the package's dependencies will be automatically installed. You can verify if the kalmus has been
installed in your environment using the pip command::

    $ pip show kalmus

Alternatively, in version 1.3.7 and above, you can check the version of installed kalmus using its
``.__version__`` attribute

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import kalmus
    >>> print(kalmus.__version__) # Warning: The __version__ attribute is not available in the kalmus v.1.3.6 and backward
    >>> 1.3.7


For users with Apple M1 Chip (arm64 Architecture)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As mentioned in [issue #4](https://github.com/KALMUS-Color-Toolkit/KALMUS/issues/4), kalmus cannot build natively on Apple M1 processors because of kalmus's dependencies on scikit-image, scikit-learn, scipy, and numpy. You may be able to install kalmus under a Rosetta emulation with Python 3.7.
